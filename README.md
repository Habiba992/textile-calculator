## Overview

The **Fabric Cost Calculator** is an automated tool designed for the textile industry to calculate fabric costs efficiently, eliminating the need for manual calculations. By inputting simple parameters like length, width, cost per square meter, and wastage percentage, the tool quickly calculates the total fabric cost. This helps streamline operations in textile businesses, reducing calculation errors and improving overall efficiency.

## Features

- **Length & Width Input (meters):** Enter the dimensions of the fabric.
- **Cost per Square Meter:** Add the price per square meter for accurate cost calculation.
- **Wastage Calculation:** Allows input of wastage percentage to include material loss in the final cost.
- **Instant Calculation:** Hit the 'Calculate Cost' button for immediate results.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use form for input and quick output.
